## Introduction to WebSphere Automation

[<span class="underline">IBM WebSphere
Automation</span>](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-automation) (WSA)
is focused on delivering value into existing WebSphere Application
Server (WAS) environments, helping administrators reduce the cost,
effort, and risk of addressing common vulnerabilities, automating tasks,
and remediating capacity incidents.

It removes manual toil so that your team can spend more time innovating
while minimizing the cost of extending the life and maximizing the ROI
of your WebSphere investments.

In conversations with customers, the same three concerns come up
repeatedly. Organizations need to keep their IT estate secure and
compliant, resilient to disruption and running optimally while reducing
costs and maximizing ROI.

WSA helps organizations gain visibility, operational efficiencies, and
cost savings quickly by extending the life of WebSphere investments and
giving teams time back to focus on unlocking new value and fixing the
imbalance of pure maintenance versus innovation tasks.

  - WebSphere operators and administrators save time and embrace
    DevSecOps by implementing patches more efficiently on virtual and
    container environments to keep operations compliant and secure.

  - Enhance remediation capabilities with insights and recommendations
    to improve the speed and depth of understanding of outages and
    anomalies as they occur.

  - Augment the operational experience with access to simplified and
    consolidated information that enables teams to act.

With WSA, security, business efficiency and resiliency become standard.
IBM can meet you wherever you are in your optimization and automation
journeys to help you quickly deliver value and increase ROI, all while
laying a solid automation foundation to support future growth.

IBM WSA is available as a stand-alone offering or as an addition to IBM
Cloud Pak® for Watson AIOps. As part of IBM Automation platform, IBM
WebSphere Automation includes containerized components and common
software services on top of a common automation layer, to manage
WebSphere’s incidents, hybrid applications, and cost with complete
observability, governance, and compliance.

Deploy virtually anywhere through containers supported by Red Hat®
OpenShift® software, on IBM Cloud®, on essentially any existing
infrastructure on-premises, or through private and public clouds. Use
only the capabilities you need with a fully modular approach that’s
designed to be easy to consume.

One of the WSA capabilities is automating memory leak detection and
analysis in order to speed time to corrective action. With WSA,
operation teams no longer need to gather problem diagnostic information
manually or analyze heap dumps. WSA handles that for you and provides an
analysis report that can be shared with the application development team
or app vendor.

## Business Context

You are a WebSphere Administrator, part of a WebSphere Operations Team
responsible for maintaining health of the WebSphere estate in the
enterprise. A typical “as-is” process for maintaining health for
WebSphere environments is depicted below.

**Today (as-is):**

1.  Manually monitor the application memory usage and take actions when
    seeing the heap usage keeping increasing.

2.  Manually capture heap dumps

3.  Go through heap dumps and try to find the root cause of the memory
    leak.

Currently, this is a very manual, time-consuming process, and you'd like
to automate this process to direct valuable time and resource elsewhere.
This is where **IBM WebSphere Automation will help\!**

**You would like to have:**

  - **Management dashboard:** Consolidated dashboard increases awareness
    and response time to the health of your WebSphere and Liberty
    servers

  - **Automated problem investigation:** Let WebSphere Automation track
    new health issue across your existing traditional WebSphere and
    Liberty environments, on virtual machines or containers.

  - **Contextual notifications:** Receive health bulletin notifications
    only when new health issue affect the environment you manage,
    reducing noise and interruptions to the WebSphere operations team.

  - **Shared, live visibility to key stakeholders:** WebSphere operators
    and development teams can see the real-time health posture of the
    WebSphere estate, accelerating action and minimizing the risk of
    miscommunication.

In this lab, you are going to use a traditional WebSphere Application
Server and a Liberty Server registered with WSA and monitored by Instana
to drive a memory leak investigation.

![Diagram Description automatically
generated](./images/media/image2.png)

You are going to use a sample application and a script which is going to
continuously add objects to the heap to create a memory leak event.
Instana will detect such event and will initiate a communication with
WSA to inform that a leak has been detected. Once that is done, WSA will
open an investigation and begin gathering the necessary problem
diagnostic information for that server. You can see the investigation is
opened and the process which it goes through. These processes include:

  - Memory leak detected

  - Identifying server

  - Collecting heap dump

  - Analyzing heap dump

  - Investigation complete

In the end of the investigation, WSA provides an analysis summary which
indicates the likely potential root cause of the memory leak. In this
case it is a vector inside the sample application which is being hosted
by the servlet wrapper. WSA also allow you to simply download all the
files that you need with your application development team or
application vendor so that they could take the action to fix the
application.

At the end of this lab, you will learn how WSA can automatically:

  - detect memory leaks before they cause a crash

  - gather problem determination (PD) information while the leak is in
    progress

  - analyze the PD info and produce a report which can be exported and
    share with app development teams or app vendors

    is timer to do it, otherwise you can skip this step. In the Terminal
    window, clone the Git repository used for this lab with the
    following command:

        cd /home/ibmuser
 
        git clone https://github.com/IBMTechSales/WAS-Automation-LabFiles.git
 
    These commands above clone the public repo named
 **WAS-Automation-LabFiles** to the local directory under
 /**home/ibmuser/WAS-Automation-LabFiles** directory.

9.  Run the script named **register_was_liberty** in the
    **WAS-Automation-LabFiles/ lab2-MemoryLeak** directory to register
    WAS server and Liberty server to WSA.

        chmod +x /home/ibmuser/WAS-Automation-LabFiles/lab2-MemoryLeak/*.sh
 
        /home/ibmuser/WAS-Automation-LabFiles/lab2-MemoryLeak/register_was_liberty.sh

10. Once the script execution is completed, go back to the WSA page and you can see that the WAS server and Liberty server are registered
    with WSA.

    ![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically

# Part 3: Configure WebSphere Automation integration with Instana and WebSphere/Liberty Servers

WSA is communicating with Instana to receive real-time Instana alerts.
WSA also to access the VMs where registered WebSphere and Liberty
servers are hosted to collect problem diagnostic information. The
following steps walk you through the integration process.

1.  Import the WSA certificate into Instana

    In this part, you create a keystore with the WSA certificate and add it to Instana. This is done by using any current keystore (in the lab you are using the **cacerts** keystore), import the WSA certificate, then copy the keystore to the Instana server and add the keystore to the Instana configuration.

    a. From the Terminal, make copy a current cacerts with the command:
 
        cp /opt/instana/agent/jvm/lib/security/cacerts .
 
    b. Retrieve WebSphere Automation certificate with the command:
 
        echo | openssl s_client -showcerts -servername cpd-websphere-automation.apps.demo.ibmdte.net -connect cpd-websphere-automation.apps.demo.ibmdte.net:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -inform pem > cpd.pem


    c. Import the certificate to the keystore file with the command:
 
        keytool -importcert -file cpd.pem -alias ibm.com -keystore cacerts -storepass changeit -noprompt

    The output is showing like this:

    <table>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>[ibmuser@student ~]$ keytool -importcert -file cpd.pem -alias ibm.com -keystore cacerts -storepass changeit -noprompt</p>
    <p>Certificate was added to keystore</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    d. Verify that the certificate has been imported

        keytool -list -alias ibm.com -keystore cacerts -storepass changeit

    The output is showing like this:

    <table>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>[ibmuser@student ~]$ keytool -list -alias ibm.com -keystore cacerts -storepass changeit</p>
    <p>ibm.com, Mar 9, 2022, trustedCertEntry,</p>
    <p>Certificate fingerprint (SHA1): AD:D6:9A:48:75:C8:99:5A:3F:67:8F:FA:92:7A:42:64:6B:DC:B8:6F</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

2. Copy the keystore file to Instana server

        scp cacerts ibmadmin@instana:cacerts
 
    When prompted, type **yes** and enter the ibmadmin user password as: **passw0rd**

    <table>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>[ibmuser@student ~]$ scp cacerts ibmadmin@instana:cacerts</p>
    <p>The authenticity of host 'instana (10.0.0.2)' can't be established.</p>
    <p>ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:2iiLhGeEpq7CO7VZxNezQp2jCabOWIBXWD+aevSHwYI.</p>
    <p>Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes</p>
    <p>Warning: Permanently added 'instana,10.0.0.2' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.</p>
    <p>ibmadmin@instana's password:</p>
    <p>cacerts 100% 150KB 18.2MB/s 00:00</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    a. Access Instana server to adjust Instana settings to use the keystore certificate.

        ssh ibmadmin@instana

    When prompted, type **yes** and enter the **ibmadmin** user password as: **passw0rd**

    b. Edit the **settings.hcl** file.

        sudo vi settings.hcl

    When prompted, enter the **ibmadmin** user password as: **passw0rd**

    c. Add the line **custom\_keystore="/home/ibmadmin/cacerts"** to the beginning of the file and save the change.

    ![Graphical user interface, text Description automatically
 generated](./images/media/image30.png)

    d. Update Instana with the command.

        sudo instana update -f /home/ibmadmin/settings.hcl
 
    This will restart the Instana server and it will take a few minutes.

    <table>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">

    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    e. When the Instana server is updated, verify that the custom keystore has been enabled and end the ssh session

        cat /var/log/instana/console.log | grep Keystore
 
        exit

    <table>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>[ibmadmin@instana ~]$ cat /var/log/instana/console.log | grep Keystore</p>

    <p>logout</p>
    <p>Connection to instana closed.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

3.  Create a SSH key on the OCP node and copy it over to all WAS
    instances

    In order for WebSphere Automation to be able to collect data for you WAS instances, you need to create a SSH key for their communications.

    
    a. Issue command to create a new SSH key with passphrase. In the lab the passphrase used is: **passw0rd**

        ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/wsa

    ![Text, letter Description automatically
generated](./images/media/image31-a.png)

    b. Copy the key over to the WAS server to be monitored. In this lab the following command is used:

         ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/wsa ibmuser@student.demo.ibmdte.net
 
    When prompted, type **yes** and enter the **ibmuser** user password
 as: **engageibm!**

    c. Test the login to the WAS server from the WebSphere Automation
    server via ssh key with the key passphrase.

        ssh -i ~/.ssh/wsa ibmuser@student.demo.ibmdte.net
 
        exit

    d. Setting up WebSphere Automation for SSH to Linux or UNIX servers

        oc login -u ibmadmin -p engageibm
 
        oc project websphere-automation
 
        oc create secret generic wsa-ansible \
          --from-literal=ansible_user=ibmuser \
          --from-literal=ansible_port=22 \ 
          --from-file=ssh_private_key_file=/home/ibmuser/.ssh/wsa \
          --from-literal=ssh_private_key_password=passw0rd
 
        ssh-keyscan student.demo.ibmdte.net >> /home/ibmuser/wsa_known_hosts
 
        oc create configmap wsa-ansible-known-hosts \
          --from-file=known_hosts=/home/ibmuser/wsa_known_hosts


4. Test the ssh connection from IBM WebSphere Automation to the WAS environment, using the following commands: 

        MANAGER_POD=$(oc get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/component=runbook-manager -o name | head -n 1)

        oc rsh $MANAGER_POD runcli testConnection student.demo.ibmdte.net linux


    The output is looking like:

    <table>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>[root@dns ~]# oc rsh $MANAGER_POD runcli testConnection student.demo.ibmdte.net linux</p>

# Part 4: Configure Instana for memory leak alert

This section describes the steps to configure Instana for the memory
leak alert to be used by WSA. The actives include creating a custom
payload, an alert channel, a custom event and an alert, which are done
using Instana administrative console.

1.  Create a custom payload.

    You can create a custom payload by using the Instana administrative
console or using the Instana API, in the lab, you are using the Instana administrative console.

# Part 5: WebSphere memory leak check with WebSphere Automation

In this section, you run a script to create memory leak incident for an
application running in a WebSphere Application server instance which is
already registered in WebSphere Automation. When WebSphere Automation
detects the memory leak, it automatically conducts the analysis to
identify the root cause.

1.  Start the WebSphere application server. From the Terminal window,
    run the command below to start the WebSphere application server:

        /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer9056/bin/startServer.sh tWAS_9056_server

2.  Go back to WSA page in web browser and click **Health** icon.

    ![Graphical user interface, application, Teams Description
 automatically generated](./images/media/image55.png)
 
    Since all the application are working fine at this time, you do not see anything in the Health page yet.
 
    ![Graphical user interface, text, application Description
  automatically generated](./images/media/image56.png)

3.  In this lab, you can also monitor the WebSphere application server
    memory change in Instana.
    
    a. In Instana page, click **Infrastructure** icon, click
        **Comparison Table**, select **JVMs** from the dropdown, and click **bootstrap WAS90.SERV1.**

    As you can see, currently there is not any issue with the WAS server.

    ![Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description
 automatically generated](./images/media/image58.png)

4.  From the Terminal window, run the script to increase application
    heap usage which will create application memory leak event.

        /home/ibmuser/WAS-Automation-LabFiles/lab2-MemoryLeak/curl_MLApp_add_was.sh

    The script output is showing like this:

    <table>
    <tbody>

10. Now WSA has successfully detected and analyzed WAS memory leak
    issue, it has sent you another email to confirm that.

    ![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated](./images/media/image69.png)

11. you can run a script to reduce the heap usage and then stop the WAS
    server with the commands:

        /home/ibmuser/WAS-Automation-LabFiles/lab2-MemoryLeak/curl_MLApp_removeLast.sh

        /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer9056/bin/stopServer.sh tWAS_9056_server



# Part 6: Liberty memory leak check with WebSphere Automation

In this section, you are going to create a Liberty application memory
leak event and use WSA to detect and analyze the problem.

1.  Start the Liberty server with the command:

        /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty200012/bin/server start Liberty_200012_server

    The output is like this:

    <table>
    <tbody>
